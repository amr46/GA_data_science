Introduction to the data set - 

This is a data set authored by Dr. Hans Hofmann at the University of Hamburg's statistics department. 

The data set represents a sample of data containing 24 independent variables and a final 'cost' variable. 

The independent variables represent a range of factors of individuals who pose credit risks. 

These variables range in type from qualitative (Attribute 1 status of existing checking account) to continuous data like variable 2 - Duration in months

We use K-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes classification to build models to fit this data. 

The models will be trained on subsets of the data set ranging from 50-80% of the data. Then, the remainder of the data set will be used as a test set to see how well the model did. 

Then different chunks of data will be chosen and new models built and scored against the complementary sets of data in a process known as N-fold cross validation. Here N represents the number of iterations of partitioning the master data set into training and test sets. 

The point of N-fold cross validation is to make sure that the errors from models generated by the algorithms are considered when being trained on different sections of the data set. 

We will randomize the data rows to ensure an even distribution.
