Paper Chosen: power of positive and negative words
==================================================

Objective:
----------

The objective of the paper was to establish a relationship between 3 specific aspects of words in various languages. The 3 aspects were 'valence' (a psychological term used to denote the reference-neutral positive or negative impact of a word), frequency of usage or occurrence of the word in the native language, and the amount of information conveyed in each of the words. 

Hypotheses:
-----------

The relationship (or hypotheses) postulated by the authors was in most cases correlative, or partially correlative. 
The main discernible hypotheses the authors made were

- There are more positive words used than negative words by human beings in logged communication (interweb, books, etc). 
- Higher valence words (or more positive words) conveyed lower amounts of information and 
  conversely lower valence words carried more.  
- There is a stronger relationship between valence and self-information than between valence and frequency of use. 
- The information content of words were generally more useful in determining length as opposed to the 
  frequency which was not as useful in determining the same.
- There was a strong negative correlation between probability of occurence of a word and the amount of
  information conveyed.  
- Context influlences the correlation between valence and information content. 


Methodologies Used:
-------------------

- Correlative relationships were demonstrated using Pearson's and Spearman's correlation methods. 
- Google's corpus of 10^21 expression tokens was used in determining frequency of occurrence of various words.
  To counteract a possible bias from the net-based origin of the above data set, the authors used
  alternate sources of extracts from multiple books and texts. 
- Valences were normalized to a range from -1 to 1 for demonstrative purposes.
- Where correlations were weak, the authors broke down their hypotheses into partial correlations 

How well did the methodologies work:
------------------------------------

- The methodologies used worked to support the hypotheses in most cases. 
- There was more evidence in support of the hypotheses presented for the English language than Spanish or German
- Context evaluation had to be limited n-grams where 2<=n<=4, so their findings are somewhat limited. 

Impression of the paper:
------------------------

- The authors have a set of hypotheses, and have developed a set of generalized correlation measures to gauge the
  validity of their hypotheses. I believe that they have over-generalized their findings. 
- The authors based the entire paper on several corpuses of information derived from human writing either logged online 
  or on paper, papyrus, and subsequently transcribed. A fundamental aspect missed here is conversational linguistic
  transactions. A large portion of negative valence words and expressions are often conveyed in speech and not usually
  written down, for fear of some kind of reprisal. 
- Their sample set relied primarily on English as a corpus, and much less so on Spanish and German, or any other language. 
  For example, Chinese, Hindi and other East-Asian language have very high context based word valence for N-grams where 
  N<=3, and even for N=1 for very high frequency words. 
- There have been no attempts (or none presented in the paper) to build valence generalizations from word roots. 
  E.g. the prefixes 'pro' and 'in' as in proactive and inactive, can be used to make a large number of 
  simplifications to a valence generalization model.   
- English, as a spoken language, has not retained its classical roots or grammatical structure, and has faced many cultural mutations.
  Subsequently the attempt to standardize the occurrences and valences or information conveyed by large subsets of the language
  are missed or skewed for cultural reasons.
