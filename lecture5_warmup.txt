Bayes Theorem for Standard Texas Holdem

Preflop - 
A big help
Two cards present
Based on the cards, can calculate number of 'GOOD' hands. 
Eg. What is the chance I'll see 3 more spades given that I have 2 spades for a flush
Eg. What is the chance that I my gutshot straight draw wil be successful?

The Flop - 
3 cards on the table. 
The number of possibilities become smaller, but the chances of winning (or folding) become clearer. 
Based on betting of other people, and the cards in hand, can make assumptions of what the other players have.
